                <p>A colleague and I have been driving the introduction of coding best practices, including modular code, specifications gathering, code design, testing, continuous integration, code review and bug tracking.</p>
                <h1>Development best practices</h1>
                <p><i>Speechmatics</i> was originally an R&D house and as such there was very little focus on coding standards. This led to a fragile code base, and a large proportion of the developers’ time spend dealing with technical debt. This problem needed to be addressed to build reliable, maintainable and scaleable code, a core requirement of the language model building pipeline.</p>
                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p><i>Speechmatics</i> came out of a speech research and development house from an academic origin, inheriting most of the cost base. As is common in academic R&D, there were no formal coding standards. The code base was tightly coupled and fragile, and much of the developers’ was spent dealing with this - usually hunting very deep bugs.</p>
                <p>My project, the model building pipeline, was required to be maintainable, scaleable and reliable. This would be very difficult to achieve with the levels of technical debt and limited coding standards.</p>
                <h1>Solution</h1>
                <p>As the developer who designed and implemented the prototype pipeline, I could introduce some coding standards. After extended discussions, I persuaded my line manager that this was the correct course of action - I hope the success of the prototype reinforced my arguments. My experience of good coding practice was limited, having recently come from academia and freelancing, but I introduced clear naming conventions, modular programming, working from specifications gathering and initial code design. These alone led to the prototype pipeline being significantly more stable and productive.</p>
                <p>Shortly after the prototype was implemented, a more experienced developer came to work at Speechmatics. He and I were enthusiastic to introduce testing; all code we wrote from then used unit testing to explore all possible pathways through the code, and we also set up an integration test. These were run automatically using the gitlab continuous integration framework, allowing us to catch bugs before they hit production. We also introduced code review, which led to my code becoming much clearer, moving away from my tendency to write code with mathematical notation (a hangover from my PhD) and using a broader range of Python features.</p>
                <p>These helped the coding process significantly, and after some difficulties with the underpinning libraries and some infrequently accessed functionality stopped working we introduced some component testing at the interfaces between these libraries and our code. After some bugs surfaced multiple times, we introduced more formal regression testing.</p>
                <p>Finally, with the introduction of Jira, an issue tracking product, we kept track of all our bugs. Additionally, we record pipeline failures with the error and the likely cause, allowing us to focus on the most pressing fixes.</p>
                <h1>Results</h1>
                <p>The automated language building pipeline is now the most stable and reliable software at <i>Speechmatics</i>, with features and bug fixes making it to production rapidly. Although subjective, I'd also argue it is the simplest to maintain, with fewer bugs and those bugs being fixed more quickly. It is by far and away the most pleasant software in the company to develop on.</p>
                <p>Code review and CI have been enthusiastically adopted by the whole team, the benefits being easily recognised, and the entire company now uses code review. Unit testing has been adopted with reasonable enthusiasm by the team, although regular reminders are required during the code review process.</p1>
                <h1>Limitations</h1>
                <p>Although me and my colleague try to maintain these coding standards, the wider company has only adopted code review. Without a consensus among the technical leadership that these are good ideas, we have to rely on our ability to persuade others, which has limits.</p>
                <p>It has also been difficult to persuade my other team members to systematically introduce component and regression tests, as these are often time consuming to build. We’ve also not had success persuading others to record the reasons for pipeline failure. We have built some tooling to make this easier, but it’s not clear if these will help uptake.</p>
                <p>We hope that as time goes on and we continue to review code, these practices will be adopted more generally.
