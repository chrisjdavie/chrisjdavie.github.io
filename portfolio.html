                <h2>Chris Davie <small>- Data engineer, software developer</small></h2>

<p>I’m a Python developer and Data Engineer with a PhD in Physics. I've delivered three small and
    medium sized software projects, so far all using Python. I’m currently searching for a new role,
    preferably with a data focus in a friendly team that writes high quality code (techniques like TDD,
    CI/CD and YAGNI where appropriate).</p>

<p>I’ve designed and helped implement 3 significant software projects, 2 helping drive revenue. I built
    batch processing pipelines for <i>Wayhome</i>, automatically <a href=portfolio/property_pipeline.html>selecting properties for shared ownership</a>. Similarly, I designed and helped
    implement pipelines for <i>Speechmatics</i>, automatically <a href=portfolio/speech_to_text.html>training speech-to-text transcription models</a>.
    For <i>Lineup Lab</i>, I built an algorithm that <a href=portfolio/sports_algorithm2.html>helps fantasy sports players</a>.</p>

<p>My <a href="#portfolio">portfolio</a> above describes these projects in more detail.</p>

<p>I’ve mainly worked in Python so far, I’ve used a range of libraries including Flask, SQLAlchemy,
    Celery, pytest, invoke, numpy, scipy, matplotlib and Luigi. I’m proficient in a number of other
    technologies, including Docker, Google Cloud Platform, PostgreSQL, redis and RabbitMQ. I've also
    programmed in C++ and FORTRAN.</p>

                        <p>Tutorfair were very lucky to have Chris undertake a project for us when he was at The ASI. He provided us with visualisations of where Tutorfair tutors were working through his technically complex, yet easy-to-understand maps.</p>
                    
                        <p>What's more, when presenting he was comfortable answering both statistical, and conceptual questions in a detailed manner, always answering thoroughly, and with healthy dose of wit!</p>

                        <p>Chris has been part of a team here working on various data science projects. In addition to his technical skills, what we find very valuable is he is quick to understanding clients needs and identifying the right questions to ask and steps for solving complex problems. He's been delivering top quality work for us and to a tight schedule. A dedicated professional who's fun to work with. He is a valuable member of the team.</p>

                        <p>Chris is detail oriented, diligent, and approachable. A great combination when it comes to data. He helped us understand the consumption of fruit and vegetable per income in the UK, which is instrumental to our work at Cookit. The visual result of the data was clean and clear and we envisage to use the code and math in forthcoming projects. All in all I am happy to say that Chris is able to execute a scope diligently and add to the table when he sees potential of adding insights.</p>

                        <p>Chris and I have collaborated on data science projects for Tutorfair, analyzing tutor performance and availability, and Antidote, where we examined consumer spending traits over the past few years. It was nothing short of a pleasure to work with Chris, whose natural aptitude for data visualization and coding were invaluable throughout our work. Chris's sharp attention to detail and strict adherence to deadlines guaranteed the quality and efficiency of our projects, and his clear thinking and lucid exposition make him an ideal person to bounce ideas off. Chris is a first-class data scientist whose skills will lend themselves well to future projects!</p>
