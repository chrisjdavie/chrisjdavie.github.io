Just two categories,'good news' or'bad news', is quite simple and can be quite subjective \u2013 if there was doubt, I tried to think in terms of the shareholders."

This is similar to the comparison tutorial \u2013 at the same sample size, it reliably predicted the classification of one type of data but not the other.  This was probably due to the weightings assigned to vocabulary by the classifier for'bad news' being clearer \u2013 words like'debt','FCA','charges' and'cost' often occurred in bad news story \u2013 the vocabulary for'good news' wasn't as clear."

This is encouraging for the extension of this project to larger sample sizes."

The tutorial I compared to scaled well with increasing sample size, so it does give hope that this will also improve.  The classifier here improved from 50 samples to 99 samples, and should do so again.  More articles will also allow comparisons of more sophisticated classifiers, beyond the basic linear classifier used here.",
                        "The second issue was concerning turning this into a useful too.  I didn't really know anything about data science when I set out, and the code would be challenging to extend (often it was the first solution that came to mind).  If I redid it, I'd do my web scraping using tools designed for that, not Python string comprehension, and use document databases as the store.  And probably other things differently, but those are the obvious ones.",

This seems like it should be a tractable problem, given there are words in English that communicate sentiment - debt','depression','FCA', for instance.",
