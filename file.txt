Chris Davie - Data engineer, software developer

   I’m a Python developer and Data Engineer with a PhD in Physics. I've
   delivered three small and medium sized software projects, so far all
   using Python. I’m currently searching for a new role, preferably with a
   data focus in a friendly team that writes high quality code (techniques
   like TDD, CI/CD and YAGNI where appropriate).

   I’ve designed and helped implement 3 significant software projects, 2
   helping drive revenue. I built batch processing pipelines for Wayhome,
   automatically [17]selecting properties for shared ownership. Similarly,
   I designed and helped implement pipelines for Speechmatics,
   automatically [18]training speech-to-text transcription models. For
   Lineup Lab, I built an algorithm that [19]helps fantasy sports players.

   My [20]portfolio above describes these projects in more detail.

   I’ve mainly worked in Python so far, I’ve used a range of libraries
   including Flask, SQLAlchemy, Celery, pytest, invoke, numpy, scipy,
   matplotlib and Luigi. I’m proficient in a number of other technologies,
   including Docker, Google Cloud Platform, PostgreSQL, redis and
   RabbitMQ. I've also programmed in C++ and FORTRAN. I’m always trying to
   learn new things - I’m currently building my fundamental computing
   skills.

Testimonials Nice things people have said about me

     Chris is an excellent data engineer and programmer. He has a deep
     technical understanding of the field, ranging from traditional
     relational data technology to streaming and implementing production
     machine learning solutions.

     Working with Chris he has built both conventional data pipelines and
     bleeding edge mathematical computing with equal care and attention.
     He works closely with business stakeholders to identify problems and
     is adept at designing effective solutions that fix business
     problems.

     He has a natural passion for learning and is a remarkable critical
     thinker. While we've worked together he's been a constant source of
     new ideas.

     His passion for learning extends into his approach to sharing his
     expertise. Chris is an excellent teacher. Generous with his time, he
     takes care to coach and train his colleagues, preferring to help
     them learn how to solve problems themselves.

   Johnny Morris, Chief Data Officer at Wayhome

     I really enjoy working with Chris. No matter what the challenge, he
     communicates everything extremely well and is able to find creative
     and clever solutions. If I could, I would lock him up for another 6
     months!

     Chris is an excellent developer and problem solver. Fast,
     Communicative, Creative. He is a rare find and I look forward to
     working with him on future projects.

   Blake Pender, Founder of Lineup Lab

     Tutorfair were very lucky to have Chris undertake a project for us
     when he was at The ASI. He provided us with visualisations of where
     Tutorfair tutors were working through his technically complex, yet
     easy-to-understand maps.

     What's more, when presenting he was comfortable answering both
     statistical, and conceptual questions in a detailed manner, always
     answering thoroughly, and with healthy dose of wit!

   Sam Floy, Head of Tutors at Tutorfair

     Chris has been part of a team here working on various data science
     projects. In addition to his technical skills, what we find very
     valuable is he is quick to understanding clients needs and
     identifying the right questions to ask and steps for solving complex
     problems. He's been delivering top quality work for us and to a
     tight schedule. A dedicated professional who's fun to work with. He
     is a valuable member of the team.

   Angie Ma, COO at The ASI

     Chris is detail oriented, diligent, and approachable. A great
     combination when it comes to data. He helped us understand the
     consumption of fruit and vegetable per income in the UK, which is
     instrumental to our work at Cookit. The visual result of the data
     was clean and clear and we envisage to use the code and math in
     forthcoming projects. All in all I am happy to say that Chris is
     able to execute a scope diligently and add to the table when he sees
     potential of adding insights.

   Juliana Zarate Davila, Co-founder at Cookit

     Chris and I have collaborated on data science projects for
     Tutorfair, analyzing tutor performance and availability, and
     Antidote, where we examined consumer spending traits over the past
     few years. It was nothing short of a pleasure to work with Chris,
     whose natural aptitude for data visualization and coding were
     invaluable throughout our work. Chris's sharp attention to detail
     and strict adherence to deadlines guaranteed the quality and
     efficiency of our projects, and his clear thinking and lucid
     exposition make him an ideal person to bounce ideas off. Chris is a
     first-class data scientist whose skills will lend themselves well to
     future projects!
