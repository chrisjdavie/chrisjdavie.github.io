                <p>Hope you're finding my portfolio interesting - would be good to hear from you (<a
                        href="mailto:cjdavie@googlemail.com?Subject=From%20my%20site"

                            id="ref1">1</a></sup> </p>

                <p>(<a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/chris-davie/7a/54b/a37">My linkedin</a>, if you're here for
                    that).</p>

                <p>I've been a data engineer and software engineer for the last few years. Prior to that I was an
                    algorithm design and data analysis freelancer and consultant, I started after finishing my PhD in
                    computational physics at Imperial College London.</p>

                <p>I hope my portfolio shows I enjoy solving problems, building useful products and discovering patterns
                    and behaviour in complex systems. It's great when the things I've build get used - it's getting
                    good, useful solutions out that I find most rewarding.</p>

                <p>I also hope my portfolio shows an ongoing tendency to build solutions to pretty complicated problems
                    and see them (often!) through to completion.</p>

                <p>My preference for building working solutions means I aim for the more efficient, well established
                    solutions. I've built novel systems - algorithm development and complex parallelisation during
                    freelancing and my PhD, when I was doing something new and off-the-shelf solutions weren't
                    available, or it needed to be really fast, but if there's a library or framework out there I'll try
                    and use it.</p>

                <p>I also prefer high quality code and test driven development, it takes more time up front but it's way
                    easier to fix. I always try to deliver cost effective solutions for the people I work for,
                    delivering the simplest working solution I can.</p>

                <p>I find using these statistical and machine learning techniques really fascinating when applied to
                    human behaviour - understanding what groups of people do, when and why, and how adjusting that can
                    change behaviours. One of the most interesting papers I've read involves <a
                        href="http://blog.kiraradinsky.com/2014/10/09/algorithmically-predicting-riots-and-civil-unrest/">algorithmically
                        predicting riots and civil unrest.</a> It's amazing.</p>

                <p>I could go on, but that's probably enough. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

                <p><sup id="fn1">1. My old boss and I disagreed about cat pictures on the internet. They are quite
                        clearly the single best thing on the internet, and when I say things like that she looked at me
                        scornfully. She was otherwise pretty sane.<a href="#ref1"

                                rendered in - I suspect it's to do with the reactive content, or some such. And this is
                                what you're reading just at the moment, on a standard HD screen at 100% zoom this should
