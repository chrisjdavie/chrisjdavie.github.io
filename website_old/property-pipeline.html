                <p><i>Basic schematic of the property processing pipeline.</i></p>
                <h1>Help to buy your home</h1>
                <p><i>Wayhome</i> helps its customers buy their home - the customer buys 5%, <i>Wayhome</i> buys 95%.
                    The customer then pays rent on the part they don’t own, and gradually buys out <i>Wayhome</i></p>

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p><i>Wayhome</i> needed to automatically select the properties a potential customer could choose, from
                    a pool of hundreds of millions of property updates.</p>
                <p>The properties we presented to the customer had to be both good for the customer and good for
                    <i>Wayhome</i> - good quality, fair rent and the house price likely to grow. These properties
                    needed to be selected automatically, there are thousands of new properties listed in the UK a
                    day. The data scientists had previously built metrics and machine learning models to decide
                    which properties to show, these needed to be reliably applied to all newly listed properties.
                </p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>I designed and built a batch processing pipeline to serve the property listings to our customers.
                    The pipeline ran daily - the most rapidly changing input, these listing updates, arrived at a rate
                    of a few thousand a day, while the time to purchase a property is typically months. A delay of 24
                    hours to display the property was fine.</p>
                <p>The listings were gathered from our providers every day and stored in a data lake. For new
                    listings, the data was initially cleaned and then combined with geographical data, including
                    flood and noise data. We then used our in-house machine learning model to predict the likely
                    rent a property would bring.</p>
                <p>Finally, using heuristics calculated by the data team, we filtered for properties we could likely
                    buy, and sent those listings to be displayed on our website.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>

                <p>The data pipeline ran for several months, delivering the transformed listings data to our potential
                    customers. The pipeline ran at greater than 95% reliability, sufficient to fully satisfy the
                    team at <i>Wayhome</i>.</p>

                <h1>Analytics datamart</h1>
                <p>In addition to being shown to the customers, the property data needed to be straightforwardly
                    analysed by the data team in a listings datamart.</p>

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The raw listings were not useful for the data scientists - it was a large amount of
                    data, hundreds of millions of rows, with thousands added and updated every day. This data was
                    spread across multiple sources, in different formats, it wasn’t always correct or consistent and
                    had many duplicates. This data needed to be transformed to allow straightforward analysis by the
                    data team and stored in a datamart for easy access.</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>The initial gathering, storing, cleaning and combining was handled by the customer listings data
                    pipeline. Unlike the customer listings pipeline, the properties weren't filtered - the data team
                    wanted to analyse all the historical listings. The datamart pipeline transformed the data into a
                    normalised model, and loaded it into the datamart for the data team to use.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The listings datamart was used regularly by the data team in their analytics - it became the primary
                    reference for listings data, allowing the data team to more rapidly analyse clean, well modelled
                    data, helping deliver timely analysis for <i>Wayhome</i>.</p>

                <h1>Engineering process</h1>
                <p>This initial pipeline was built delivering value in small chunks - the highest value work,
                    delivering listings to customers, was handled first, then each table in the analytics datamart
                    was added one at a time. This work was completed, and fairly reliably ran each day.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I wrote a test framework to allow automated testing and test-first development when
                    writing our BigQuery queries.</p>
                <p>As there were many queries being processed, these were batched and run concurrently. Once we had
                    the initial pipeline running, we found a number of limitations with BigQuery - a wait of two
                    hours to update data, leading to processing delays and the datamart being in an inconsistent
                    state. Additionally, the queries to BigQuery would often hang. As more queries were added to the
                    pipeline, these failures caused significant decreases in reliability, needing the pipeline to be
                    regularly restarted.</p>
                <p>This was addressed in two ways - firstly the tables that managed the pipeline and the tables in
                    the analytics datamart were moved to PostgreSQL, eliminating the update delay and removing the
                    unreliable queries, and secondly we detected hung queries, abandoning and restarting them. With
                    these changes, the reliability of the pipeline satisfied all our stakeholders.</p>
