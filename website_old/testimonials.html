                    extremely well and is able to find creative and clever solutions. If I could, I would lock him up
                    for another 6 months! </blockquote>

                    complex, yet easy-to-understand maps.<br><br>

                    What's more, when presenting he was comfortable answering both statistical, and conceptual questions
                    in a detailed manner, always answering thoroughly, and with healthy dose of wit!</blockquote>

                    identifying the right questions to ask and steps for solving complex problems. He's been delivering
                    top quality work for us and to a tight schedule. A dedicated professional who's fun to work with. He

                    data. He helped us understand the consumption of fruit and vegetable per income in the UK, which is
                    instrumental to our work at Cookit. The visual result of the data was clean and clear and we
                    envisage to use the code and math in forthcoming projects. All in all I am happy to say that Chris
                    is able to execute a scope diligently and add to the table when he sees potential of adding
                    insights.</blockquote>

                    few years. It was nothing short of a pleasure to work with Chris, whose natural aptitude for data
                    visualization and coding were invaluable throughout our work. Chris's sharp attention to detail and
                    strict adherence to deadlines guaranteed the quality and efficiency of our projects, and his clear
                    thinking and lucid exposition make him an ideal person to bounce ideas off. Chris is a first-class
