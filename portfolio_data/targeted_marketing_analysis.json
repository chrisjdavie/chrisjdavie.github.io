The regions with high sales were also prioritised \u2013 the Tutorfair infrastructure was well established in those regions, and would support an increase in demand.  I also looked for regions where tutors would visit for tutoring, but didn't have many sales, as additional targets for increased marketing.",
                        "To find the tutor coverage, I calculated how far each tutor had travelled, and used this to estimate where in London they'd be willing to go. This was calculated using where the tutor lived and where the tutor had tutored, using the tutor and sales databases. I then estimated typical travel distances and potential coverage.",

Using these results, Tutorfair directed their marketing efforts towards the recommended regions, increasing the Google Ads bidding.",
