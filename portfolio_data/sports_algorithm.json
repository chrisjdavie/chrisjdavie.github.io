As part of a new premium product, they required an algorithm that would find the best teams using all the players in a given sport league, up to 350 players in 9 positions, in a few seconds. This would provide their users with a comprehensive selection of the best teams for use in fantasy sports.",

After researching known solutions in the literature, I wrote a simple proof of principle using the test data, prototyped a version of this using Python and implemented a full speed version using the Python libraries numpy and itertools.",
                        "The final algorithm was a tree-based algorithm, using multiple interacting trees of players and positions, exploiting many features of the data; as an example, any player with a lower salary and higher points value would be picked first. This arrangement was also true of knapsacks and sub-combinations of knapsacks. The solution also involved combinatorics and conventional code optimisations."

I provided an updated solution based on this new data, which consistently solved the problem in the required time. After a final round of testing, adding features and bug fixes, we were happy with the performance and reliability of the algorithm.",
                        "The algorithm was then deployed to the live server during the product release, underpinning all the solutions produced by the website, and has performed reliably ever since.",
