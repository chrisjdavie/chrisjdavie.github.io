# Lineup Lab described with Wardley Maps

## <small> Learning about Wardley Maps, using them to describe developing an algorithm

___

Wardely Maps are a technique to enable communication of the structure and direction a project, to allow better decisions with this projects. As a developer, they have the potential to allow me to communicate many complexities of the decisions I'm making on technical projects to my business colleagues - more clearly represent my understanding of the environment (organisational structure, teams around), communicate how the things I'm building depend on each other and this wider environment, and reach better informed decisions with my colleagues have, day-to-day, exposure to the detail of different chunks of the problem.

As I'm learning Wardely Maps, I'm using them to describe the evolution of a project I worked on for a year, and it's evolution from R&D to a core compentent driving revenue at a startup.

# Lineup Lab

Lineup Lab helps sports gamblers make better decisions, with the aim of enabling them to win more; I've written more about it **HERE**. At the core of the pO

* Move knapsack problem to low product - knowledge, "Theory"
# What is a Wardley map
* X axis - evolution
* * In this context, software
* Y axis - visibility
* * Distance to customer, direction of dependencies
* What are the lines?
* * Links in a dependency chain (the dependencies are not universally downwards, away from the customer)
* *  "There is a flow of risk, information and money between components."
# Explain the project by expanding nodes
* from the first, customer facing nodes, representing the solution to customer problems
* adding on the next layer, next layer, etc, until external contract
# Initial R&D project
* R&D from blake
* Brief 
* * Based on provided example, build solver
* * 2/3 liner on LuL, link to longer write up
* MAP!
* And I ran with it
* * Blake provided example
* * wrote direct solver
* * looked up research
* * implemented a solver
* * ran against the prototype
* Explain arrows
* * Blake gaining more experience
* * As project ran, Blake got more examples
* * The main point of the project was to drive the prototype to "custom built" - something that could be used in production to drive customer value
# First working solver
* describe stage ADD MOAR
* extra nodes - built interface
* nodes changed nodes - direct solver became part of the manual tests
* switch names - Prototype to solver
* Dependency isn't so much on research, it's now on my knowledge
* Explain arrows
* * Focus of the work was the solver, but the other processes went along with it
# More sports
* Bugs also drove the examples
