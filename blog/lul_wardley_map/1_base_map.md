# Lineup Lab described with Wardley Maps

## <small> Learning about Wardley Maps, using them to describe developing an algorithm

___

I'm learning Wardely Maps, to more clearly articulate my thoughts. Here, I use it to describe the evolution of a project I worked on, from R&D to a core compentent driving revenue at a startup.

* Move knapsack problem to low product - knowledge, "Theory"
# What is a Wardley map
* X axis - evolution
* * In this context, software
* Y axis - visibility
* * Distance to customer, direction of dependencies
* What are the lines?
* * Links in a dependency chain (the dependencies are not universally downwards, away from the customer)
* *  "There is a flow of risk, information and money between components."
# Explain the project by expanding nodes
* from the first, customer facing nodes, representing the solution to customer problems
* adding on the next layer, next layer, etc, until external contract
# Initial R&D project
* R&D from blake
* Brief 
* * Based on provided example, build solver
* * 2/3 liner on LuL, link to longer write up
* MAP!
* And I ran with it
* * Blake provided example
* * wrote direct solver
* * looked up research
* * implemented a solver
* * ran against the prototype
* Explain arrows
* * Blake gaining more experience
* * As project ran, Blake got more examples
* * The main point of the project was to drive the prototype to "custom built" - something that could be used in production to drive customer value
# First working solver
* describe stage ADD MOAR
* extra nodes - built interface
* nodes changed nodes - direct solver became part of the manual tests
* switch names - Prototype to solver
* Dependency isn't so much on research, it's now on my knowledge
* Explain arrows
* * Focus of the work was the solver, but the other processes went along with it
# More sports
* Bugs also drove the examples
