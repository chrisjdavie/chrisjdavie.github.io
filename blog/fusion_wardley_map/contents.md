* Justify the prosition of "Plasma Physics" - explanatory, not predictive, but doesn't predict or explain particularly well
* Data science stage of evolution 
* * I - initial analysis
* * II - explanatory (and automated - dashboards)
* * III - predictive
* * IV - predictive, and automated (in prod, automated test and build)
* Need to comment on the competitors evolution
* * Renewables - Solar, Wind close to commodity behaviour
* * Nuclear fision - If you don't mind radioactive waste, Fission already works, is mature, but suffers huge HR issues (plants need to stop melting down/leaking, globally)
