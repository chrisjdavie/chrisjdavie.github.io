                 <p>I worked with <a href="http://www.lineuplab.com/"><i>Lineup Lab</i></a>, a fantasy sports website, to develop a custom algorithm that underpins a new premium product range.</p>
                <p><i>Skills employed:  Algorithm design, Mathematics, Python, (numpy, scipy), project design, Linux</i></p>
                 <img class="style-svg" src="images/lineuplab.svg" alt="example of a player tree">
                 <p><i>A visualisation of a tree, the type of algorithm developed for Lineup Lab.  Here, each node is a better choice than the nodes behind.  The colour shows the depth of the tree from the trunk node.</i></p>
                 <h1>Customer</h1>
                 <p><i>Lineup Lab</i> is a website that helps fantasy sports players calculate the players for their optimal fantasy teams for basketball and American football each day.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>
                 
                 <p><i>Lineup Lab</i> is part of the new fantasy sports market, which only came into existence in 2009.  Now, 6 years later, it is at least billion dollar market and looks set for continued rapid growth.</p>
                 
                 <h1>Challenge</h1>
                 <p><i>Lineup Lab</i> had an algorithm that could generate the best teams from any 50 players in a given sports league.  As part of a new premium product, they required an algorithm that would find the best teams from all the players in a given sport league, up to 350 players, in a few seconds.  This would provide their users with a comprehensive selection of the best teams for use in fantasy sports.</p>

<p>There are trillions of possible teams with all the players considered, and a direct computation of this would take more time and computational resources than they had.</p> 

<p>(The problem is a variant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#Multiple_knapsack_problem">“the multiple choice knapsack problem”</a>, a problem that, in this case, is known to be NP-hard.)</p>
                <h1>Solution</h1>
<p>I designed and implemented the algorithm to solve this problem.  After researching known solutions in the literature,  I wrote a simple proof of principle using the test data, prototyped a version of this using Python and implemented a full speed version using the Python libraries Numpy and Itertools.</p>

<p>The final algorithm was a tree-based algorithm, using two interacting trees of players and positions, exploiting many features of the data; as an example, any player with a lower salary and higher points value would be picked first.  This arrangement was also true of knapsacks and sub-combinations of knapsacks.</p>
                <h1>Results</h1>
                <p>While the initial algorithm worked on all the test data, it was later found to sometimes slow down during testing on the development server against real-world data, no longer providing an answer quickly enough for <i>Lineup Lab</i>'s use.  I provided an updated solution based on this new data, which consistently solved the problem in the required time.  After a final round of testing, adding features and bug fixes, we were happy with the performance and reliability of the algorithm.</p>

<p>The algorithm was then deployed to the live server as during the product release, underpinning all the solutions produced by the website, and has performed reliably ever since.</p>

<p>We went on to work together on another set of sports and adding additional features to the algorithm.</p><br>

<sup id="fn1">1. To win in fantasy sports the user must build a team with the highest possible "points" after a series of games - for example, in football a player who scores more goals would gain more points.<br>

Each user has a certain budget to buy players for their team, with each player having a price, based on their previous performance.  Each player also has a corresponding statistical projection of their success, from other sources.<br>

Using <i>Lineup Lab</i>, the user can find the best team for a given budget, using these statistical scorings.<a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
