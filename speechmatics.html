                 <p>I work at <a href="https://www.speechmatics.com/"><i>Speechmatics</i></a>, a provider of automatic speech recognition, automating the building of ASR systems in multiple languages.</p>

                 <p><i>The global language coverage by Speechmatics, as of June 2016.</i></p>
                 <h1>Speechmatics</h1>
                 <p><i>Speechmatics</i> provides the most accurate cloud-based speech recognition, with a per-hour pricing, and also provides on-premesis solutions. 
                 
                 <h1>Challenge</h1>
                 <p><i>Speechmatics</i> had a largely manual process for building ASR systems, using their state-of-the-art deep neural net technologies. This manual process worked in English and German, and they had ambitions for automatically building ASR systems for as many world languages as they have data for. While the system for building these new languages had been proven with German, the system needed to be automated, and made robust, reproducible and scaleable to 10s of languages.</p>

                <h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Building speech recognition systems has two parts - the lanuage model and acoustic model. I designed and built a proof-of-principle for the automation of building the acoustic model. This design combines the <i>Speechmatics</i> machine learning technology, some reworking of the software design methods, unit and integration testing and open-source pipeline software; we are finalising the choice of the library in light of the sucess of the acoustic model pipeline prototype. I also designed the data handling system, including the databases and data ingestion, allowing rapid storing and processing of many thousands of hours of audio data, in many languages from a range of sources - both internal and external.</p>

<p>My team is now converting the existing <i>Speechmatics</i> code to this design. The design principles and technologies used are also being employed in the language modelling pipeline, allowing a robust framework for automatically building a full ASR system, from the initial data to a fully tested model, ready for deployment in the cloud.</p>

                <h1>Results</h1>
                <p>The proof-of-principle has successfully built ASR systems for many languages, including French, Spanish, Itallian, Romanian, Portuguese and Polish. It is currently being adapted to work with languages quite distinct from English, including Russian and Korean, and regional variations, Brazillian Portuguese as a first. Three of these languages are now live and being used by our customers.</p>

                <h1>Future work</h1>
                <p>The automated pipeline will shortly be used to rebuild the existing language systems due to updates to the underlying machine learning technologies. (English will still be built in a more manual way, as this does produce slightly better results than the automated system). The pipeline code base will be then moved to the pipeline libraries, and we will start working on the rule set for automatically scheduling new language builds, with the goal of having the entire process, of ingensting the data, chosing and starting the language builds and building the tested model being largely automated.</p>
