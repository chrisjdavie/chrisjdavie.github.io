<h2>Chris Davie <small>- Data engineer, sofware developer</small></h2>

<p>I’m a Python developer and Data Engineer with a PhD in Physics. I've delivered three small and
    medium sized software projects, so far all using Python. I’m currently searching for a new role,
    preferably with a data focus in a friendly team that writes high quality code (techniques like TDD,
    CI/CD and YAGNI where appropriate).</p>

<p>I’ve designed and helped implement 3 significant software projects, 2 helping drive revenue. I built
    batch processing pipelines for Wayhome, automatically <a href={{name_porfolio_link.property_pipeline}}>selecting properties for shared ownership</a>. Similarly, I designed and helped
    implement pipelines for Speechmatics, automatically training speech-to-text transcription models.
    For LineupLab, I built an algorithm that helps fantasy sports players.</p>

<p>My portfolio above describes these projects in more detail.</p>

<p>I’ve mainly worked in Python so far, I’ve used a range of libraries including Flask, SQLAlchemy,
    Celery, pytest, invoke, numpy, scipy, matplotlib and Luigi. I’m proficient in a number of other
    technologies, including Docker, Google Cloud Platform, PostgreSQL, redis and RabbitMQ. I've also
    programmed in C++ and FORTRAN. I’m always trying to learn new things - I’m currently building my
    fundamental computing skills.</p>
